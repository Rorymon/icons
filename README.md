## Usage

Self-service applications are displayed in the Intune Company Portal app or at the [Microsoft Intune Web Company Portal](https://portal.manage.microsoft.com/) for install. Using high quality product icons ensures users see a familiar interface when accessing these applications.

## Intune Company Portal icons

A set of icons have also been resized to look better in the Intune Company Portal. The icons canvas size has been resized to provide more space around the icon and broadly align to icons that appear in the Microsoft Store.

Below is an example of the Intune Company Portal showing Microsoft Store and Win32 applications with consistent icons providing a more visual appealing experience.
